# Andrid Project

## General info
This application is part of a technical test for the position of Android Developer.
The objective of this project is to put into practice some required concepts.
The proposal is an application that allows you to log in, edit your profile, view a list of information and obtain your current position.

## Technologies
The main technology I used was [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). Then I also used [Material Design](https://material.io/) to design the interface, [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for push notifications,
[Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) as REST Client library.
